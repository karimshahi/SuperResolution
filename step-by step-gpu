Installing cuDNN compatible with CUDA 11.8

To install cuDNN that is compatible with CUDA 11.8, follow these steps:

Check System Requirements : Ensure that your system meets the requirements for CUDA 11.8 and the corresponding version of cuDNN.
Download cuDNN :
Go to the NVIDIA cuDNN website .
Sign in with your NVIDIA account or create one if you donâ€™t have it.
Navigate to the download section and select the version of cuDNN that is compatible with CUDA 11.8.
Download the appropriate package for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
Install cuDNN :
Extract the downloaded cuDNN package.
Copy the files to the CUDA installation directory. Typically, this will involve copying:
cudnn*.h file to the include folder (e.g., /usr/local/cuda/include/ on Linux).
libcudnn* library files to the lib64 folder (e.g., /usr/local/cuda/lib64/ on Linux).
Make sure to update your environment variables if necessary (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux).
Verify Installation :
Run a sample program or test script to ensure that cuDNN is correctly installed and working with CUDA 11.8.
